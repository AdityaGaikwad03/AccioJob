<!-- HTML List Creation
Let's make some of our own using HTML lists. Make 2 lists identifying the use of the money you'll make from the job.

Acceptance Criteria:
Requirement	Description
Ordered List	Create an ordered list of 3 items that you'd like to buy with your salary. This list should have data-ns-test attribute in the li element and value of the attribute should be shoppingList.
Unordered List	Create an unordered list of the holiday destinations that you'd like to visit after you got a job. It should at least have 3 places. This list should have data-ns-test attribute in the li element and value of the attribute should be holidayList.
Extra Info:
Understanding Custom Attributes
- In HTML, you can define your own attributes for the majority of elements using the data-* prefix. Any attribute on an element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute.

- In the context of this task, data-ns-test='shoppingList' and data-ns-test='holidayList' are examples of custom attributes. These attributes allow you to store extra information that doesn't have any visual representation. Custom attributes are mainly used to store information within HTML tags, which can later be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript or similar technologies.

- The value inside the custom attribute can be anything that suits your needs, in this case, identifying two different types of lists. -->
