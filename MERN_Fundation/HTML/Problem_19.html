Here are the requirements:

Requirement	Description
Nested Tables	Create 4 nested tables within a main table. Follow the image for layout.
Headers	Each nested table should have specific headers. For example, one table should have "Nested Table 2," "Column 1," "Column 2" as headers.
Lists	Include a list in one of the tables with the items "List item 1," "List item 2," "List item 3."
Background Color	One of the cells in the nested tables should have a black background with white text that contains "HTML."
NOTE	Keep all headings and texts exactly same as they are mentioned in question
Ensure that your HTML code closely follows the structure in the image, and submit your completed work for evaluation.
