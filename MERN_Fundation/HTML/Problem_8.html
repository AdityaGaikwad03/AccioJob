<!-- HTML Document Creation: Time and Space Complexity
Your task is to create an HTML document that describes the concepts of Time Complexity and Space Complexity. The document must adhere to the following structure and content:

Element	Description	Count	Keywords
h1	Heading for the document	1	Time, Space, Complexity
p	First paragraph explaining Time Complexity	1	Time complexity, efficient
p	Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity	1	Space Complexity, O(n)
b	Bold text within the second paragraph	1	Space Complexity
Instructions:
The h1 element must include the words Time, Space, and Complexity.
The first paragraph must contain information about Time Complexity, including the words 'Time complexity' and 'efficient.'
The second paragraph must contain information about Space Complexity, including the words 'Space Complexity' and 'O(n).'
Within the second paragraph, the text 'Space Complexity' should be bold.
Note: Make sure to include exactly two paragraphs with appropriate h1 and b tags as described above. Follow the given structure and content to ensure your solution aligns with the requirements. -->

  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. Understanding time complexity helps in designing efficient algorithms.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the input.
