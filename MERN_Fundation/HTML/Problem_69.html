<!-- Bold Highlighter
Objective:
Create a JavaScript program that highlights bold (<strong>) words inside a paragraph when a user hovers over a specific link. When the user moves the mouse away, the highlighted words should revert to their original color.

Requirements:
The webpage contains a paragraph with some words wrapped in <strong> tags.
There is a link that, when hovered over, triggers the highlight effect on the bold words.
When the mouse moves over the link, all <strong> elements should turn green (rgb(0, 128, 0)).
When the mouse moves out of the link, the <strong> elements should return to black (rgb(0, 0, 0)).
Implementation Details:
You will write the code only inside script.js.
You need to implement two functions:
highlight(): Changes the color of all <strong> elements to green.
return_normal(): Reverts the color of <strong> elements to black.
These functions should be triggered on mouseover and mouseout events of the link.
Use document.querySelectorAll() to select all <strong> elements.
Loop through the selected elements and modify their style.color property.
Behavior Expectations:
Mouse Over the Link:
All words inside <strong> tags change to green (rgb(0, 128, 0)).
Mouse Out of the Link:
The highlighted words return to black (rgb(0, 0, 0)).
Example HTML Structure:
<p>
  This is an <strong>example</strong> paragraph with some <strong>important</strong> words.
</p>
<a href="#" onmouseover="highlight()" onmouseout="return_normal()">Hover over me!</a>

Bold Highlighter

Test Cases:
Check Highlight on Hover:

Move the mouse over the link, and verify that all bold words (<strong>) turn green.
The CSS color property should be rgb(0, 128, 0).
Check Revert on Mouse Out:

Move the mouse away from the link, and ensure the bold words revert to black.
The CSS color property should be rgb(0, 0, 0).
Hints:
Use document.querySelectorAll('strong') to get all <strong> elements.
Loop through the elements using forEach and change their style.color property accordingly.
Ensure the functions are called correctly in the onmouseover and onmouseout attributes of the <a> tag. -->
